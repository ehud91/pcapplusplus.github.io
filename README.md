## Overview

This web-site is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

The API reference is generated using [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/). The Doxygen files are located under the `static/api-docs/<version>/doxygen` directory and include the `Doxyfile` file and `mainpage.dox` which is the API main page.

Most of the content is organized in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) files which are easy to generate and maintain and can include React components for extended capabilities. Some pages like the landing page and the versions page are pure React (`tsx`) pages. The API reference is static HTML files which are generated by Doxygen.
