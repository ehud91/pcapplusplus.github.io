PcapPlusPlus consists of 3 libraries:

- __Packet++__ - a library for parsing, creating and editing network packets
- __Pcap++__ - a library for intercepting and sending packets, providing network and NIC info, stats, etc. It is actually a C++ wrapper for packet capturing engines such as libpcap, WinPcap, Npcap, DPDK and PF_RING
- __Common++__ - a library with some common code utilities used by both Packet++ and Pcap++

The dependency model between the libraries is as follows:

That means, you can use __Common++__ separately from the other libraries, and you can also use __Packet++__ without __Pcap++__.

All of PcapPlusPlus APIs including classes for all of these libraries, files, data structures, etc. are documented in details using [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/).
